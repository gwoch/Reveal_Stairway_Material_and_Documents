# Reveal_Stairway_Material_and_Documents

his a NEW Repository file that comes from the original Repository 'Reveal_Stairway'. 

This will only contain my BLOG, images and photoshop doucment. 

This is my independent project for the collaboration of team ‘Break the Build’. We have been assigned to test and produce new effects and coding so that we may join together in the future to create our survival horror game.
IN MY GITHUB REPOSITORIES, look for ‘Break-the-Bill’ as that is our collaborative repository. You will see the list that we have come up with.
My assignment from the team from the last few weeks:
1.	Create animation for platforms to appear e.g. stairs appear before the player (level Blueprint, Matinee).
2.	Operate a key mechanic, door can only be open by a key (include widget text/images to pop up).
NOTICE 22/11/2017:
I’ve forgot to add my screenshot and videos from the last few projects a while ago, so go check them my repositories BluePrintLesson1 and ThirdPersonProject for those updates.
